	programming interface (API) for accessing hardware performance counters
	available on most modern microprocessors. These counters exist as
	a small set of registers that count events, which are occurrences
	of specific signals and states related to the processor's function.
	Monitoring these events facilitates correlation between the structure
	of source/object code and the efficiency of the mapping of that code
	to the underlying architecture. This correlation has a variety of
	uses in performance analysis, including hand tuning, compiler optimization,
	debugging, benchmarking, monitoring, and performance modeling. In
	addition, it is hoped that this information will prove useful in
	the development of new compilation technology as well as in steering
	architectural development toward alleviating commonly occurring bottlenecks
	in high performance computing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new program
	for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief
	summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest
	scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here
	we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing
	several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological
	accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option,
	MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe
	a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two
	profiles.RESULTS:We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with
	CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest
	previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured
	using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test
	three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings),
	highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between
	the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm
	on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to
	CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude
	less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length
	282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.CONCLUSIONS:MUSCLE
	offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment
	accuracy compared with currently available programs. MUSCLE is freely
	available at http://www.drive5.com/muscle webcite.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The alignment of multiple protein sequences is a fundamental
	step in the analysis of biological data. It has traditionally been
	applied to analyzing protein families for conserved motifs, phylogeny,
	structural properties, and to improve sensitivity in homology searching.
	The availability of complete genome sequences has increased the demands
	on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) programs. Current MSA methods
	suffer from being either too inaccurate or too computationally expensive
	to be applied effectively in large-scale comparative genomics.RESULTS:We
	developed Kalign, a method employing the Wu-Manber string-matching
	algorithm, to improve both the accuracy and speed of multiple sequence
	alignment. We compared the speed and accuracy of Kalign to other
	popular methods using Balibase, Prefab, and a new large test set.
	Kalign was as accurate as the best other methods on small alignments,
	but significantly more accurate when aligning large and distantly
	related sets of sequences. In our comparisons, Kalign was about 10
	times faster than ClustalW and, depending on the alignment size,
	up to 50 times faster than popular iterative methods.CONCLUSION:Kalign
	is a fast and robust alignment method. It is especially well suited
	for the increasingly important task of aligning large numbers of
	sequences.},

	multiple alignments. However, in contrast to other methods Kalign2
	does not allow externally supplied position specific gap penalties.
	Here, we present a modification to Kalign2, KalignP, so that it accepts
	such penalties. Further, we show that KalignP using position specific
	gap penalties obtained from predicted secondary structures makes
	steady improvement over Kalign2 when tested on Balibase 3.0 as well
	as on a dataset derived from Pfam-A seed alignments.Availability
	and Implementation: KalignP is freely available at http://kalignp.cbr.su.se.

	method using standard norm-conserving pseudopotentials and a flexible,
	numerical linear combination of atomic orbitals basis set, which
	includes multiple-zeta and polarization orbitals. Exchange and correlation
	are treated with the local spin density or generalized gradient approximations.
	The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space
	grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and exchange-correlation
	potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that
	scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy
	functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions
	and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional,
	without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally,
	using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation
	time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly
	with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated
	efficiently and accurately, thus allowing structural relaxation and
	molecular dynamics simulations.},

	integrating sampled and event-based measurements capable of low-overhead,
	highly detailed measurements and therefore particularly convenient
	for initial performance analyses. Then we apply iteration profiling
	to scientific codes, and present an algorithm for reducing the memory

	clustering. Finally, we evaluate the complete integration of all
