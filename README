To offer full functionality, the clustering tool needs the following libraries
to be installed on your system

* Muster clustering library

http://tgamblin.github.com/muster/main.html

* Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL)

http://www.cgal.org/

* GNU MPFR (needed by CGAL)

http://www.mpfr.org/

* The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (needed by CGAL)

http://www.gmplib.org

* Boost headers and Boost thread libraries (needed by Muster and CGAL)
