ChangeLog 'ClusteringSuite'

YYYY-MM-DD  John Doe  <johndoe@example.com>

	* myfile.ext (myfunction): my changes made
	additional changes

	* myfile.ext (unrelated_change): my changes made
	to myfile.ext but completely unrelated to the above

	* anotherfile.ext (somefunction): more changes

2012-07-05 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Changed the random sampling in 'TraceData'. Previous version was buggy
	in 64 bit systems.

	* Changed the 'kalign2' building rules to just compile the files really
	used.

2012-07-03 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Full implementation of 'ClustersSequenceScore' as an independent binary.
	It does not use 'libTraceClustering' due to the bad integration of the
	CSV parser and the library.

	* First implementation of a 'CSVDataExtractor', just with basic features.
	It is a first (experimental) version that does not communicate with the
	Parameters Manager.

	* Erased remaing 'SeqAn' tags/calls/etc.

	* Added 'kalign2' calls to 'system_messages' class to correctly show the
	alignment progress.

	* Added 'system_messages' hooks to call percentage progress from C code.

2012-06-29 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Erased all references to SeqAn library in SequenceScore code. It is still
	pending the license problems of Kalign2

	* Updated the 'svn:keywords' to all new files in added to the package.

2012-06-28 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Major change in 'SequenceScore' algorithm. Remove use of SeqAn library.
	Embedded code of Kalign2 application. It is still experimental but
	lot faster than Muscle (the SeqAn MSA algorithm). The compilation still
	requires SeqAn because of the sequence containers.

	* Added new binary 'ClustersDiff' that compares two CSV cluster result
	files using the Mirkin Distance

	* Added prototypes for 'ClustersSequenceScore' isolated binary that loads
	a CSV cluster result file.

	* Added a CSVDataExtractor skeleton to extract data points from CSV cluster
	files (needed to 'ClustersSequenceScore', 'ClustersDiff' uses a simplistic
	CSV parser).


2012-06-12 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* Changed the default datatype for the CGAL kernel

	* Checks for hulls having 3 points or more before trying to intersect them. 
	Hulls may have less than 3 points when the all points have the same value in one
	dimension, forming a line instead of a polygon which ends up crashing CGAL.

2012-02-27 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* Added script draw_stats to print a DOT graph with each MRNet node statistics.

2012-02-27 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* Changed the transmission protocol for hulls in Tree-DBSCAN algorithm so
	that all hulls are transmitted at once in a single package, rather than 
	one by one.

	* Added statistics to display the work done in each node of the MRNet tree.

2012-01-17 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Solved a bug in 'libTraceClusteringImplementation' related to PRV trace 
	reconstruction, when using events instead of states

2011-12-28 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.>
	* Modification in the 'PlottingManager' to only add the 'basename' of the
	DataFileName to the GNUPlot scripts

	* Changes in the internal CGAL kernel to ensure the precision of the
	Hull operations (now, it uses a multiple precission data type offered by
	CGAL, plus an 'lazy' kernel). It is supposed to be more expensive than
	the previous implementations using 'doubles'

	* Adaptative 'MinPoints' values in the TreeDBSCAN across the different
	tree levels. The BackEnds set this value to 3, but this has to be changed
	

2011-12-15 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Added 'Timer.cpp' forgotten in last commits

	* Modifications in the TreeDBSCAN backend messages

	* Corrected a bug when printing global/local data on libDistributedClustering

	* Modifications to print same timing information in TreeDBSCAN and
	BurstClustering

2011-12-13 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Added sampling support to trace data extraction (parameter '-m' to burst
	clustering binary). That includes a modification on ClusteringAlgorithm
	class which imposes the extension of Classifier class

	* Modification in CGAL building system to avoid search of default paths

	* Added microsecond resolution to Timer class

2011-11-30 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Changed ours CGAL's kernel precision from float to double

	* Moved the generation of output files from the generic ClusteringBackend
	to its derived classes (new virtual method ProcessResults())

	* Tree_DBSCAN_env.sh now updates the PATH variable

	* Added script 'draw_hulls'

	* Added some missing BSC headers and debug messages

2011-11-25 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* Modified Makefile to include HullManager in TreeDBSCAN filter.

	* Modified configure.ac.template to include BOOST_LDPATH in
	CGAL_DYNAMIC_PATH.

2011-11-24 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* Added a new filter to exchange the global clustering dimensions in 
	TreeDBSCAN

2011-11-24 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Added a facade object 'HullModel' to make transparent the 
	'ConvexHullModel' object. *Some memory leaks regarding the 'HullModel'
	container destruction could have been added*

	* Improvement on building system to correctly propagate the library 
	modifications to the 'TreeDBSCAN' source files

	* Solved a bug when compiling without SeqAn support

2011-11-22 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* Modified script 'Tree_DBSCAN_env.sh' to set the proper environment

	* Fixed bug in gmp_mpfr.m4 (mpfr_libsdir path was wrong) and

2011-11-22 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* Makefiles in TreeDBSCAN changed to generated static binaries

	* Tree_DBSCAN_env.sh now sets the ClusteringSuite libraries directory in
	the LD_LIBRARY_PATH

2011-11-22 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* TreeDBSCAN MRNet protocol separated into 3 independent libraries
	for external use (lib*TreeDBSCAN)

	* Serialization and transmission of convex hulls over the MRNet
	centralized in HullManager.cpp

	* Added on-line back-end that extracts data from a tracing library

	* Modified 'clustering-config' script

2011-11-21 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Changed the name of 'sourceme.sh' to 'Tree_DBSCAN_env.sh'

	* Added 'EXTRA_DIST' to 'clustering-config' script

2011-11-21 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Added 'TreeDBSCAN' source code that implements a tree version
	approach to parallelize DBSCAN using the MRNet infrastructure

	* Added a CGAL kernel (obtained from the CGAL examples) to include
	density information to CGAL points. The points contained in this
	kernel are still bidimensional. To avoid a problem of CGAL when
	determining the polygon intersection algorithnm this points
	contain a vector of 'float' instead of 'double. That could be a
	potential problem

	* Better use of CGAL flags in the building system. Also added the
	macros to check the presence of 'MRNetApp' library

	* Added 'Code:Blocks' project files


2011-11-14 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Better support for versioning

2011-11-14 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Changed the 'config.h' file to 'clustering_suite_config.h' to 
	better integrate to external tools

	* New modifications on CGAL/MPFR/GMP building system

	* Clusters information file generation feature added to
	'libDistributedClustering'

	* Added compatibility to unified printing of Hull models. It is
	a buggy feature. *It needs to specify a normalized plot definition
	to print the hulls*

2011-09-01 German Llort <german.llort@bsc.es>
	* Added a size method and a new merge implementation on the Convex
	Hull model

	* Changed the way to return the noise points in the 
	libDistributedClustering

2011-08-31 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Solved a bug when the input paraver trace has overlapped states
	running and different from running that made the parser miss data
	from events in the overlapping time

2011-08-10 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Modification of the CGAL detection part of the building system to 
	ease the configuration/compilation

	* New features in 'libDistributedClustering' library so as to refine
	the Tree Based DBSCAN.

	* Also added a consult method to retrieve all information to start the
	cross-process analysis (LLNL)
	

2011-08-05 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Fixed regressions in the implementation of MUSTER interface

	* Fixed bug that prevented to compile 'SequenceScore' due to 
	SeqAn type difinitions

2011-08-04 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Fixed regressions in the implementation of 'libDistributedClustering'

2011-08-03 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Corrected a bug in the building system that prevented to compile
	the CGAL support properly

	* Version renamed to 2.1

2011-07-13 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Added clusters merge using last partition sequences on aggregative
	refinement

	* Solved a bug when generating the partition using the sequences merge

	* THIS VERSION WAS USED IN THE ICPADS PAPER *

2011-05-21 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Solved a bug when renaming nodes that didn't expand

2011-05-16 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Added copy of input .row files when clustering Paraver traces

	* Changed SVN keywords. Added 'Id'

	* Workaround to parse traces with incoherent number of communicators

	* Build SVN numbering changed again :D

2011-05-16 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Workaround to avoid problematic Bursts when changing HWC groups

	* Generation sequences of the last partition when applying refinement

	* Added better support to control the SVN revision

	* Cleaned headers and SVN keywords for all files

	* Solved a bug in the generation of step traces when applying the
	clustering refinement. It caused that the intermediate trace had a 
	different naming of the clusters

	* Solved a bug when seting the actual number of clusters different to
	noise in a partition. It caused the plotting manager to generate a
	plot with one more cluster that the actual number

2011-05-15 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Solved a bug in the merge step that forced to capture discarded
	leaves

	* Solved a bug when renaming new nodes, that doesn't take in
	consideration those nodes in previous levels that didn't expand

	* Solved a bug when the refinement didn't expand all possible steps
	due to 'convergence', that cause a fault when reconstructing all
	partial traces

2011-05-13 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>
	* Added two prunes in the last levels of the refinement tree: 
	1) collapse nodes that only expand in themselves and noise, 2) re-classify
	noise points on leaves.

	* Refinement is divided in two classes 'ClusteringRefinementDivisive'
	and 'ClusteringRefinementAggregative'. The first one correspond to
	the implemented top-down approach. The second one is still to be
	implemented and will correspond to a bottom-up approach, merging
	clusters with bad score, to obtain new ones better alligned.

	* ClusterInformation class, that correspond to the nodes in the
	clustering refinement tree, has now its own source files. In the
	previous version, it was part of 'ClusteringRefinement' source files

	* Solved a bug when accounting the number of individuals in the
	ClusteringStatistics class

2011-05-12 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Revision of Clustering Refinement. Now each subclustering is executed
	independently, adding the possibility to be parallelized. It also
	generates 'Graphviz' files to plot the hierarchy tree.

2011-05-03 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Added a new Paraver parser to treat bursts based on events. Now
	there are two different classes to parse 'PRVStatesDataExtractor'
	and 'PRVEventsDataExtractor'. Consequently, a new Paraver trace
	reconstructor has been added 'ClusteredEventsPRVGenerator'

	* First implementation of Clustering Refinement, consisting on a
	divisive (top-down) hierachical application of succesive DBSCAN's,
	evaluated using the Sequence Alignment score. It generates partial
	clusterings information, but has to be changed to clarify the
	outputs, and make different levels independent (to parallelize it)

2011-03-14 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Solved a problem when sorting the clusters to translated the cluster
	IDs in ClusteringStatistics class

	* Solved a problem when generating plots just with NOISE cluster

	* Solved a bug to correctly apply the clustering parameters factors

	* Solved a bug to correctly generate the revision number in the 
	configure.ac file

2011-03-10 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Added the implementation to manage the distributed tree DBSCAN in
	collaboration with German Llort, using an MRNet. This implies adding 
	a dependency to CGAL (and also MPFR and Boost Threads) to compute the
	Convex Hulls models of each cluster, and also manipulate them.

	* Added initial support to SeqAn library, to implement the sequence based
	clustering refinement.

	* Added a new binary target called 'DBSCANParametersApproximation' to
	offer the functionality of generate the K-Neighbours plot, in order to
	approximate the 'Epsilon' value.

	* Changed the building system so as to permit a simple compilation to
	generate the basic BurstClustering binary (and also the
	 DBSCANParametersApproximation binary), no needing all dependencies.

2011-01-04 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Added support to 'muster' clustering library, both sequential an parallel
	algorithms. Requires the library to be installed on the system plus
	the Boost headers and a MPI implementation, in case you want to use
	the Capek algorithm (k-medoids distributed clustering).

	* Full implementation of distributed clustering under
	'src/libDistributedClustering', to perform the tree DBSCAN. Functional, but
	not cleaned. It uses a set of Convex Hull models of the resulting clusters and
	a classifier using these hulls. It still lacks on the classification of points
	in the Eps neigbourhood (just classifies the inner and border points). This
	modifications requires both CGAL (and its dependencies like MPFR and Boost
	thread libraries).

	* Solved issues ralated to the clusters time-based rank (bad implemented in
	previous version).

	* Restructuration of shared components. Now libTraceClustering just includes
	the public face and the implementation, and the rest of classes are in
	libSharedComponents, so as to easily access from libDistributedClustering.

	* Full rewriting of the autotools building system. Now it works in MareNostrum
	without problems. It allows to set manually the dependencies, and correctly
	distribute the different flags across all the Makefiles.

	* Minor regressions solved: plots titles, headers instdir solved, 'include'
	directory Makefile.am added.


2010-10-26 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Added support to set the plots range via XML

	* Solved a bug when trying to plot normalized data plots

2010-10-25 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Global modification and restructuration of source directories

	* Current functionality is closer to the original burst-clusterizer

	* Some regresions needs to be solved
	
	* .anjuta_sym_db.db Added to keep the Anjuta symbol database

2010-10-05 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Initial submit to BSC subversion. Previous updates are
	located in 'burst-clusterizer' tool
