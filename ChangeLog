ChangeLog 'ClusteringSuite'

YYYY-MM-DD  John Doe  <johndoe@example.com>

	* myfile.ext (myfunction): my changes made
	additional changes

	* myfile.ext (unrelated_change): my changes made
	to myfile.ext but completely unrelated to the above

	* anotherfile.ext (somefunction): more changes

	* Added support to 'muster' clustering library, both sequential an parallel
	algorithms. Requires the library to be installed on the system plus
	the Boost headers and a MPI implementation, in case you want to use
	the Capek algorithm (k-medoids distributed clustering).

	* Full implementation of distributed clustering under
	'src/libDistributedClustering', to perform the tree DBSCAN. Functional, but
	not cleaned. It uses a set of Convex Hull models of the resulting clusters and
	a classifier using these hulls. It still lacks on the classification of points
	in the Eps neigbourhood (just classifies the inner and border points). This
	modifications requires both CGAL (and its dependencies like MPFR and Boost
	thread libraries).

	* Solved issues ralated to the clusters time-based rank (bad implemented in
	previous version).

	* Restructuration of shared components. Now libTraceClustering just includes
	the public face and the implementation, and the rest of classes are in
	libSharedComponents, so as to easily access from libDistributedClustering.

	* Full rewriting of the autotools building system. Now it works in MareNostrum
	without problems. It allows to set manually the dependencies, and correctly
	distribute the different flags across all the Makefiles.

	* Minor regressions solved: plots titles, headers instdir solved, 'include'
	directory Makefile.am added.

	* Added support to set the plots range via XML

	* Solved a bug when trying to plot normalized data plots

2010-10-25 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Global modification and restructuration of source directories

	* Current functionality is closer to the original burst-clusterizer

	* Some regresions needs to be solved
	
	* .anjuta_sym_db.db Added to keep the Anjuta symbol database

2010-10-05 Juan Gonzalez <juan.gonzalez@bsc.es>

	* Initial submit to BSC subversion. Previous updates are
	located in 'burst-clusterizer' tool
